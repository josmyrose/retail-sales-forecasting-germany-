### **Retail Sales Forecasting \& Business Analytics — Germany**

#### End-to-End Data Science Project | Python, SQL, Power BI, Time Series Forecasting

This repository showcases an end-to-end data analytics and forecasting project using official German economic data from the Deutsche Bundesbank.



The project is designed to reflect real-world analytics workflows used in German companies, covering:



* Data ingestion \& validation
* Data cleaning \& feature engineering
* KPI definition \& exploratory analysis
* Time-series forecasting
* Business intelligence (Power BI) preparation
* Production-oriented Python practices (logging, unit tests)

#### &nbsp;**Project Purpose (ATS-Focused)**

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in:

* Data Analysis
* Time Series Analysis
* Forecasting \& Predictive Analytics
* Business KPI Development
* Retail Analytics
* Economic Data Analysis
* SQL + Python Analytics Pipelines
* Power BI Dashboarding
* German Market \& Economic Indicators

#### **Data Source: Deutsche Bundesbank**

**Data Provider:** Deutsche Bundesbank (Germany’s central bank)
**Dataset:** Retail Trade Turnover Index (Monthly)
**Dataset ID:** BBDE1.M.DE.W.GUA1.N2G470000.A.V.I15.A



The dataset is widely used by:



* Economists
* Retail analysts
* Financial institutions
* Policymakers
* Consulting firms

Working with Bundesbank data reflects **enterprise-grade data challenges**, including:

* Metadata handling
* Index-based indicators
* Time-series validation
* Economic interpretation



#### **Dataset Characteristics** 



* Monthly time-series data
* Retail trade turnover index (not raw revenue)
* Multi-year historical coverage
* Seasonality and trend components
* Suitable for:

&nbsp;	KPI reporting

&nbsp;	Trend analysis

&nbsp;	Demand forecasting

&nbsp;	Business planning
